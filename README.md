# Optical-recognition-of-handwritten-digits-dataset-KNN
Use knn to train Optical-recognition-of-handwritten-digits-dataset

## Implementation of the following functionalities:
### f1: 
provide the details of the dataset,
### f2:
train a machine learning model by calling an algorithm from the machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, and save the model so that it can be called later. You can save a model with scikit-learn built-in functionality such as https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_persistence.html.
### f3: 
implement a machine learning algorithm by yourself, train a model with the algorithm, and save the model so that it can be called later;
### f4: 
compare the train error and test error of the two models;
### f5: 
enable the user to query the saved models with e.g., an index of the test dataset.
